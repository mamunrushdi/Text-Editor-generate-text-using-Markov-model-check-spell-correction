This program was written as an assignment of the Data Structures and Performance course offered by __UC San Diego through Coursera as the second course of 5 parts courses of _Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization___ The skeleton code as well as some starter code had been provided by UC San Diego.

### The purpose of this assignment is to calculate Flesch score, generate text using Markov model, check spell correction and provide auto completion for a word.

### Description
__1. [Flesch score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests):__ A Flesch score of text indicate how difficult a passage in English is to understand. The less is the score the difficlut is to read the text is. 
__2. Markove text:__ Predicting word what will come next using [markov model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model).
__3. Edit Distance:__ The number of modification needs to make to turn one string  into another
		_Exaple of Edit Distance:_ from __spell__ to get __mine__ needs 5 modifications.

__4. Spell Checking__ Check whether a word's spell is correct or not. After detecting a misspell, program will sugest correct words. 
__5. Autocompletio__ Whean user starts to type a word, following his typed letter, sugests words.


#### From this I course I've learnt the followings:
1. Working with Strings
1. Regular expressions
1. Efficiency Analysis and Benchmarking (Big O, Time complexity)
1. Trees! (including Binary Search Trees and Tries)
